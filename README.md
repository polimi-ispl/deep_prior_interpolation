## Abstract
Irregularity and coarse spatial sampling of seismic data strongly affect the performances
of processing and imaging algorithms. Therefore, interpolation is a necessary pre-processing
step in most of the processing workflows. In this work, we propose a seismic data interpolation
method based on the deep prior paradigm: an ad-hoc Convolutional Neural Network is used as
a prior to solve the interpolation inverse problem, avoiding any costly and prone-to-overfitting training stage.
In particular, the proposed method leverages a multi resolution U-Net with 3D convolution
kernels exploiting correlations in 3D seismic data, at different scales in all directions.
Numerical examples on different corrupted synthetic and field datasets show the effectiveness
and promising features of the proposed approach.

The inverse problem is defined starting from the sampling equation:

that is solved using the deep prior paradigm by

The estimate of the true model is then obtained as the output of the optimized network:

The architecture we propose is the MultiResolution UNet:

## Setup and Code Organization
The code mainly relies on top of pytorch. You can recreate our conda environment named `dpi`
(acronym for "deep prior interpolation") through
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
``` 
Then, activate it with `source activate dpi` before running any example.<br>
**NOTE**: if you have initialized conda through `conda init`, use `conda activate dpi` instead.

This python project is organized as follows:
 - `main.py` is the main script that actually does the interpolation
 - `parameter.py` contains the run options that the main will parse as shell arguments. Check it out!
 - `architectures` contains pytorch implementations of the networks and loss functions
 - `data.py` contains data management utilities, such as data patch extraction.
 - `utils` contains some general purpose utilities

## Usage Examples
Here we report the example tests on the 3D hyperbolic data included in the paper.

    # solve mask 1 saving the CNN weights
    python main.py --imgdir ./datasets/hyperbolic3d --imgname original.npy --maskname random66_shot1.npy --datadim 3d --gain 40 --upsample linear --epochs 3000 --savemodel --outdir TL/shot1
    # solve mask 2 from scratch
    python main.py --imgdir ./datasets/hyperbolic3d --imgname original.npy --maskname random66_shot2.npy --datadim 3d --gain 40 --upsample linear --epochs 3000 --outdir TL/shot2_scratch
    # solve mask 2 using as initial guess the CNN weights of mask 1
    python main.py --imgdir ./datasets/hyperbolic3d --imgname original.npy --maskname random66_shot2.npy --datadim 3d --gain 40 --upsample linear --epochs 3000 --outdir TL/shot2_transfer --net load --netdir TL/shot1/model.pth
    
#### Data preparation
We are glad you want to try our method on your data! To minimize the effort, keep in mind that:
 - The data dimensions are (*t,x,y*), and so are defined the patch shape and stride (during extraction).
 If you have 2D native datasets, please add an extra axis.
 - If you process the data in a 2.5D fashion, the tensors will be transposed in order to 
 tile the patches in the last dimension (as they are a channel).
 This procedure is automatic and should be reversed in the patch assembly in `data.reconstruct_patches`.
 - The subsampling mask can be made of 0 and 1; however we prefer to store the "decimated" version of the data, with NaN missing traces.
 This has the advantage of removing the ambiguity given by the zeros in the data and the zeros in the mask. 
 Nonetheless, our codes can take into account both ways.
 - We study the behaviour of the network as a nonlinear prior for the decimated data.
 Therefore we do not perform any preprocessing, a part from a scalar `--gain` for avoiding numerical errors.
